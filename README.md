# Spiel.js
###  Open source, barebones, game-oriented JavaScript library to control the HTML5 Canvas
**version 0.0.3**

## General Overview

### What is Spiel.js?
Spiel.js is a JavaScript framework that aims to help users of the HTML5 canvas have more freedom and capabilities when animating the HTML5 canvas. It is lightweight, and aims for simplicity.
### What does Spiel.js do?
Spiel.js turns your canvas into an interactive environment. Normally, when you draw on the canvas, you are just changing the color of the pixels in that canvas. When using spiel.js, the canvas is more of an environment and allows you to put objects in it, which can later be manipulated. This makes everything easier, from animations, to simply changing the values of things you've drawn on the canvas.
### Some of the features of Spiel.js include:

 -   Shapes and images in the canvas can be represented as objects, instead of simply pixels.
 -   Animations and canvas manipulations are easier, with built-in functions that help you with a variety of things from movement to collision, as well as other things.
 -   The library is lightweight, and highly customizable, giving you even more freedom when using it.

**To start using Spiel.js, simply download the `Spiel.js` file, put it in your index.html directory, and link it at the bottom of your HTML document as a script, by adding this line : 
`<script type="text/javascript" src="Spiel.js"></script>`**
